# credit-risk-classification

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a logistic regression model that predicts the likelihood of a loan defaulting (high risk) based on various features. This analysis helps in understanding the model's performance in distinguishing between healthy and high-risk loans.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 0.99
- **Precision**: 
  - Healthy Loans (`0`): 1.00
  - High-Risk Loans (`1`): 0.86
- **Recall**:
  - Healthy Loans (`0`): 1.00
  - High-Risk Loans (`1`): 0.91

## Summary
The logistic regression model's performance metrics are summarized below:
- **Accuracy**: The model correctly classifies 99% of the loans.
- **Precision and Recall**: The model performs exceptionally well for predicting healthy loans with perfect scores. For high-risk loans, the model shows good performance with high recall and precision.

Based on these evaluation metrics, the model is highly recommended for identifying loan statuses. Its high accuracy and strong performance metrics make it a valuable tool for credit risk analysis.
